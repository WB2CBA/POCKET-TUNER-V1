# POCKET-TUNER-V1

A Credit Card sized HF T-MATCH ANTENNA TUNER for QRPp and QRP Portable Operations

Some specs and aspects of this pocket tuner:

-	Works on HF Bands from 10m to 40m.

-	I can tune up to 5 watts with this tuner though my aim was more in QRPp zone which is sub 1 watt! Though I successfully used it with my ADX,QDX and QMX without any issues by keeping tuning TX times under 10

  seconds at a time not to heat up excessively. Then it works like a champ! ðŸ˜Š

-	It has a resistive tuning process indicator which is similar to any resistive tuner meaning does not stress your TRX in tuning mode by lowering SWR in tuning to 2 or lower. This is great not to expose RF PA

  output stage to excessive SWR conditions while tuning as this is the case in Automatic Antenna Tuners.
